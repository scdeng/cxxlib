CXX template library and basic graph algorithms

1.array.h
	
2.list.h

3.stack

4.queue

5.tree.h
	binary search tree

6.rbtree.h
	template red black tree

7.map.h
	map: red black tree adapter

8.set.h
	set: red black tree adapter

9.priority_queue.h
	MinPQ & IndexMinPQ: heap based priority queue implementation
	minimum priority queue: min heap
	Indexed minimum priority queue: associate each key with an index

10. union_find.h
	weighted quick union implementation with path compression

11.graph.h graph.cpp
	undirected graph
	Graph:	adjacent list
	dfs
	bfs
	connected component
	EdgeWeightGraph: adjacent list representation

13.mst.h mst.cpp
	minimum spanning tree
	a). prim's algorithm with lazy and instant verion
		lazy version implementation based on priority queue
		instant version implementation based on index priority queue
	b). Kruskal's algorithm
		implementation based on minimum priority queue and union find data structure

14.shortest_path.h shortest_path.cpp
	shortest path algorithm
	a). Dijkstra's algorithm
		implementation based on indexed minimum priority queue
		it is similiar with Prim's instant version

	a). DFA based substring search
	b). NFA based regular expressioin match
		.cancatenation			eg. AB
		.closure				eg. A*
		.or( with parentheses)  eg.  (AC|BD)
		eg. ((A*B|AC)D)
